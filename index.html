        <div class="text-story-ctr">
            <p> It all started during quarantine with a lot of my exploring about hacking
              I went into programming language and I didn't expect to be loved
              here and learn a lot. I have long wanted to learn about hacking because I am also a victim
              of scammer and hackers on FB and I told myself that I would also study to help
              I am also a victim of scams online. I had a hard time at first because there was so much written
              in the script and I can't understand what's written there because I don't have it yet
              analyzes. Until I thought of changing my thinking the way I wanted
              I learn, I told myself that “nothing is hard if you start at the beginning” love
              say that all advance is a mixture of basic, so we should start with basic
              and expand knowledge so that we can mix what we have learned and build something new
              knowledge and we can call it advance when you know a lot of the basics. It was really hard in the beginning, but
              as i said everything hard starts with "basic". I learned and started with “HTML language” and concentrated
              I used to just "copy / paste", and that's not a good job to learn. But I believe in myself
              where I can learn. What I did was "copy / paste" I did an experiment and I did
              formula so I know how the taboo code written in the script works. I found out and I do over and over again
              until I developed a wealth of knowledge and I tried it on my own without "copy / paste" and I was happy because I learned
              I made my own script and I found out here that that's how it works. We always think that there is no difficulty in the person who wants to learn, because
              everything starts with "basic".</p>
